      :"skos:editorialNote" => %(Rationale: Information about the creating application, including the version of the application and the date the file was created, can be useful for problem solving purposes. For example, it is not uncommon for certain versions of software to be known for causing conversion errors or introducing artifacts. It is also useful to determine which rendering software is available for the digital object. For example, if you know that the Distiller program created the PDF file, you know it will be renderable with \(among other programs\) Adobe Reader.).freeze,
      :"skos:historyNote" => %(Creation / Maintenance Notes: If the object was created by the repository, assignment of creating application information should be straightforward. If the object was created outside the repository, it is possible this information could be supplied by the depositor. It might also be extracted from the file itself; the name of the creating application is often embedded within the file.).freeze,
      :"skos:scopeNote" => %(Usage Notes: This semantic unit applies to both objects created external to the repository and subsequently ingested, and to objects created by the repository, for example, through migration events. The creatingApplication container is repeatable if more than one application processed the object in turn. For example, a file could be created by Microsoft Word and later turned into a PDF using Adobe Acrobat. Details of both the Word and Acrobat applications may be recorded. However, if both files are stored in the repository, each file should be completely described as an Object entity and linked by using relationship information with a relationshipType “derivation.” It may also be repeated to record the creating application before the object was ingested as well as the creating application used as part of the ingest process. For example, an HTML file was created pre-ingest using Dreamweaver, and the Web crawler Heritrix then captured a snapshot of the files as part of the ingest. The amount of information needed for creatingApplication given here is minimal. For more granularity, extensibility is provided. Rather than having each repository record this locally, it would be preferable to have a registry of this information similar to format or environment registries.).freeze,

      :"skos:historyNote" => %(Creation / Maintenance Notes: Recommended practice is for a repository to archive objects on which other objects depend. These may be sent by the submitter of the primary object, or they may in some cases be automatically obtained by the repository. For example, a markup file will often contain links to other objects it requires such as DTDs or XML Schema. If it does, these objects can often be identified by the link and downloaded by the repository.).freeze,
      :"skos:scopeNote" => %(Usage Notes: This semantic unit is for additional objects that are necessary to render a file or representation, not for required software or hardware. It may also be used for a non-executable component of the object, such as a font or style sheet. For things that the software requires, see swDependency. This semantic unit does not include objects required by structural relationships, such as child content objects \(e.g., figures that are part of an article\), which are recorded under relationship with a relationshipType of “structural”. It is up to the repository to determine what constitutes a dependency in the context of the designated community.

      :"skos:historyNote" => %(Creation / Maintenance Notes: This information may be omitted when the repository is doing only bit-level preservation on the object. Rather than having each repository record this locally, it would be preferable to have a registry of environment information similar to proposed registries of format information. Repositories may choose to design mechanisms for inheritance, so that if the environment required for each file within a representation is identical to the environment recorded for the representation as a whole, it is not necessary to store this information in each file.).freeze,

    term :Event,
      comment: %(The Event entity aggregates information about an action that involves one or more Object entities. Metadata about an Event would normally be recorded and stored separately from the digital object.
Whether or not a preservation repository records an Event depends upon the importance of the event. Actions that modify objects should always be recorded. Other actions such as copying an object for backup purposes may be recorded in system logs or an audit trail but not necessarily in
an Event entity.

If the event was a validity check \(e.g., profile conformance\) any anomalies or quirks discovered would be recorded here. All subunits of this semantic unit are optional. At least one subunit \(i.e. eventOutcomeDetailNote and/or eventOutcomeDetailExtension\) must be present if this container is included.).freeze,

    term :Fixity,
      label: "Fixity".freeze,
      :"skos:definition" => %(Definition: Information used to verify whether an object has been altered in an undocumented or unauthorized way.).freeze,
      :"skos:historyNote" => %(Creation / Maintenance Notes: Automatically calculated and recorded by repository.).freeze,
      :"skos:scopeNote" => %(Usage Notes: To perform a fixity check, a message digest calculated at some earlier time is compared with a message digest calculated at a later time. If the digests are the same, the object was not altered in the interim. Recommended practice is to use two or more message digests calculated by different algorithms. \(Note that the terms “message digest” and “checksum” are commonly used interchangeably. However, the term “checksum” is more correctly used for the product of a cyclical redundancy check \(CRC\), whereas the term “message digest” refers to the result of a cryptographic hash function, which is what is referred to here.\) The act of performing a fixity check and the date it occurred would be recorded as an Event. The result of the check would be recorded as the eventOutcome. Therefore, only the messageDigestAlgorithm and messageDigest need to be recorded as objectCharacteristics for future comparison. Representation level: It could be argued that if a representation consists of a single file or if all the files comprised by a representation are combined \(e.g., zipped\) into a single file, then a fixity check could be performed on the representation. However, in both cases the fixity check is actually being performed on a file, which in this case happens to be coincidental with a representation. Bitstream level: Message digests can be computed for bitstreams although they are not as common as with files. For example, the JPX format, which is a JPEG2000 format, supports the inclusion of MD5 or SHA-1 message digests in internal metadata that was calculated on any range of bytes of the file.).freeze,

      :"vs:term_status" => %(stable).freeze
    term :Format,
      label: "Format".freeze,
      :"skos:definition" => %(Definition: Identification of the format of a file or bitstream where format is the organization of digital information according to preset specifications.).freeze,
      :"skos:editorialNote" => %(Rationale: Many preservation activities depend on detailed knowledge about the format of the digital object. An accurate identification of format is essential. The identification provided, whether by name or pointer into a format registry, should be sufficient to associate the object with more detailed format information.).freeze,
      :"skos:historyNote" => %(Creation / Maintenance Notes: The format of a file or bitstream should be ascertained by the repository on ingest. Even if this information is provided by the submitter, directly in metadata or indirectly via the file name extension, recommended practice is to independently identify the format by parsing the file when possible. If the format cannot be identified at the time of ingest, it is valid to record that it is unknown, but the repository should subsequently make an effort to identify the format, even if manual intervention is required.).freeze,
      :"skos:scopeNote" => %(Usage Notes: A bitstream embedded within a file may have different characteristics than the larger file. For example, a bitstream in LaTex format could be embedded within an SGML file, or multiple images using different colorspaces could be embedded within a TIFF file. format must be recorded for every object. When the bitstream format can be recognized by the repository and the repository might want to treat the bitstream differently from the embedding file for preservation purposes, format can be recorded for embedded bitstreams. Although this semantic unit is mandatory, both of its subunits are optional. At least one subunit \(i.e. either formatDesignation or formatRegistry\) must be present if this container is included or both may be used. If the subunit \(formatDesignation or formatRegistry\) needs to be repeated, the entire format container is repeated. This allows for association of format designation with a particular set of format registry information. For example, if the precise format cannot be determined and two format designations are recorded, each is given within a separate format container. The format container may also be repeated for multiple format registry entries.).freeze,

      :"skos:scopeNote" => %(Usage Notes: Either formatDesignation or at least one instance of formatRegistry is required. Both may be included. The most specific format \(or format profile\) should be recorded. A repository \(or formats registry\) may wish to use multipart format names \(e.g., “TIFF_GeoTIFF” or “WAVE_MPEG_BWF”\) to achieve this specificity.).freeze,

      :"skos:editorialNote" => %(Rationale: If central format registries are available to the preservation repository, they may provide an excellent way of referencing detailed format information.).freeze,
      :"skos:scopeNote" => %(Usage Notes: Either formatDesignation or at least one instance of formatRegistry is required. If more than one formatRegistry needs to be recorded the format container should be repeated to include each additional set of formatRegistry information. The PREMIS working group assumed that a number of format registries will be developed and maintained to support digital preservation efforts. The proposal for a Global Digital Format Registry \(GDFR\) \(http://hul.harvard.edu/gdfr/documents.html#data\), for example, would create a network-accessible registry designed to store detailed specifications on formats and profiles.).freeze,

      :"skos:definition" => %(Definition: Hardware components needed by the software referenced in swName or the human user of the referenced software.).freeze,
      :"skos:historyNote" => %(Creation / Maintenance Notes: Hardware environment information can be very difficult to provide. Many different hardware environments may apply; there are a huge number of combinations of maker and type of CPU, memory, video drivers, and so on. Although at least one hardware environment should be recorded, it is not necessary to record them all and each repository will have to make its own decisions about which hardware environments to record. Because of the difficulty recording this information comprehensively, it would be optimal if central registries of environment information existed. In many cases the environment of a file object is directly associated with the format, making registry lookup by format feasible. In the absence of a global mechanism, repositories may be forced to develop their own local “registries” relating format to hwEnvironment.).freeze,

      :"skos:editorialNote" => %(Rationale: Format information may indicate whether a file is encrypted, but the nature of the encryption also must be recorded, as well as the access key.).freeze,
      :"skos:historyNote" => %(Creation / Maintenance Notes: Inhibitors are more likely to be present on an object ingested by the repository than applied by the repository itself. It is often not possible to tell that a file has been encrypted by parsing it; the file may appear to be ASCII text. Therefore, information about inhibitors should be supplied as metadata with submitted objects when possible.).freeze,
      :"skos:scopeNote" => %(Usage Notes: Some file formats allow encryption for embedded bitstreams. Some file formats such as PDF use passwords to control access to content or specific functions. Although this is actually implemented at the bitstream level, for preservation purposes it is effectively managed at the file level; that is, passwords would not be recorded for individually addressable bitstreams. For certain types of inhibitor keys, more granularity may be required. If the inhibitor key information is identical to key information in digital signatures, use those semantic units.).freeze,

Significant properties may be objective technical characteristics subjectively considered important, or subjectively determined characteristics. For example, a PDF may contain links that are not considered important and JavaScript that is considered important. Or future migrations of a TIFF image may require optimization for line clarity or for color; the option chosen would depend upon a curatorial judgment of the significant properties of the image. Listing significant properties implies that the repository plans to preserve these properties across time and requires them to acceptably survive preservation action; for example, to be maintained during emulation or after format migration. It also implies that the repository would note when preservation action results in modification of significant properties. In practice, significant properties might be used as measures of preservation success, as part of quality checking the results of a preservation action or evaluating the efficacy of a preservation method. For example, if the listed significant properties are not maintained after application of a particular preservation method, it may indicate a failure of the process or that the method is not well suited to the type of material. More experience with digital preservation is needed to determine the best ways of representing significant properties in general, and of representing modification of significant properties. The semantic units included in the significantProperties container aim to provide a flexible structure for describing significant properties, allowing general types of aspects, facets or attributes of an object to be declared and to be paired with specific significant details about the object pertaining to that aspect, facet or attribute. For example, some repositories may define significant properties for objects related to facets of content, appearance, structure, behavior, and context. Examples of facet:detail pairs in this case could include: significantPropertiesType = “content” significantPropertiesValue = “all textual content and images” significantPropertiesType = “behavior” significantPropertiesValue = “editable” Other repositories may choose to describe significant properties at a more granular attribute level; for example: significantPropertiesType = “page count” significantPropertiesValue = “7” significantPropertiesType = “page width” significantPropertiesValue = “210 mm” Each facet:detail pair should be contained in a separate, repeated significantProperties container. Further work on determining and describing significant properties may yield more detailed schemes to facilitate general description. Representing modification of significant properties as a result of preservation action also requires further work. One possible way involves the use of Object and Event information: Object A has significant properties volume and timing, which are recorded as significantProperties of A. In migrated version B, the timing is modified, which is noted in the eventOutcome of the migration event. Only volume is listed as a significant property of B.).freeze,

      :"skos:scopeNote" => %(Usage Notes: A file or bitstream can be subject to multiple encodings that must be decoded in reverse order \(highest to lowest\). For example, file A may be compressed to create file B, which is encrypted to create file C.

A compositionLevel of zero indicates that the object is a base object and not subject to further decoding, while a level of 1 or higher indicates that one or more decodings must be applied. Numbering goes lowest to highest \(first encoded = 0\). 0 is base object; 1-n are subsequent encodings. Use 0 as the default if there is only one compositionLevel. When multiple file objects are bundled together as filestreams within a package file object \(e.g., a ZIP file\), the individual filestream objects are not composition levels of the package file object. They should be considered separate objects, each with their own composition levels. For example, two encrypted files zipped together and stored in an archive as one file object would be described as three separate objects, each with its own associated metadata. The storage location of the two inner objects would point to the ZIP file, but the ZIP file itself would have only a single composition level \(of zero\) whose format would be “zip.”).freeze,

This information can be particularly important when the assigned preservationLevelValue differs from usual repository policy. For example, a repository may normally assign a preservationLevelValue of “full preservation” for JPEG2000 files, but detects that a particular file is defective.
