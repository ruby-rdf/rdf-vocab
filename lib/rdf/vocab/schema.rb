      comment: %(<p>A CreativeWorkSeries in schema.org is a group of related items, typically but not necessarily of the same kind.
          CreativeWorkSeries are usually organized into some order, often chronological. Unlike <a href="/ItemList">ItemList</a> which
          is a general purpose data structure for lists of things, the emphasis with
          CreativeWorkSeries is on published materials \(written e.g. books and periodicals,
          or media such as tv, radio and games\).</p>
<pre><code>      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

      Specific subtypes are available for describing &lt;a href="/TVSeries"&gt;TVSeries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/RadioSeries"&gt;RadioSeries&lt;/a&gt;,
      &lt;a href="/MovieSeries"&gt;MovieSeries&lt;/a&gt;,
      &lt;a href="/BookSeries"&gt;BookSeries&lt;/a&gt;,
      &lt;a href="/Periodical"&gt;Periodical&lt;/a&gt;
      and &lt;a href="/VideoGameSeries"&gt;VideoGameSeries&lt;/a&gt;. In each case,
      the &lt;a href="/hasPart"&gt;hasPart&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="/isPartOf"&gt;isPartOf&lt;/a&gt; properties
      can be used to relate the CreativeWorkSeries to its parts. The general CreativeWorkSeries type serves largely
      just to organize these more specific and practical subtypes.

      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

      It is common for properties applicable to an item from the series to be usefully applied to the containing group.
      Schema.org attempts to anticipate some of these cases, but publishers should be free to apply
      properties of the series parts to the series as a whole wherever they seem appropriate.

      comment: %(A series of <a class="localLink" href="/Event">Event</a>s. Included events can relate with the series using the <a class="localLink" href="/superEvent">superEvent</a> property.</p>
<p>An EventSeries is a collection of events that share some unifying characteristic. For example, "The Olympic Games" is a series, which
is repeated regularly. The "2012 London Olympics" can be presented both as an <a class="localLink" href="/Event">Event</a> in the series "Olympic Games", and as an
<a class="localLink" href="/EventSeries">EventSeries</a> that included a number of sporting competitions as Events.</p>
<p>The nature of the association between the events in an <a class="localLink" href="/EventSeries">EventSeries</a> can vary, but typical examples could
include a thematic event series \(e.g. topical meetups or classes\), or a series of regular events that share a location, attendee group and/or organizers.</p>
<p>EventSeries has been defined as a kind of Event to make it easy for publishers to use it in an Event context without
worrying about which kinds of series are really event-like enough to call an Event. In general an EventSeries
may seem more Event-like when the period of time is compact and when aspects such as location are fixed, but
it may also sometimes prove useful to describe a longer-term series as an Event.).freeze,

      Usage guidelines:
<br />
<ul>
<li>Use the <a href="/priceCurrency">priceCurrency</a> property \(with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes">ISO 4217 codes</a> e.g. "USD"\) instead of
      including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_sign#Currencies_that_use_the_dollar_or_peso_sign">ambiguous symbols</a> such as '$' in the value.
</li>
<li>
      Use '.' \(Unicode 'FULL STOP' \(U+002E\)\) rather than ',' to indicate a decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.
</li>
<li>
      Note that both <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/#using-the-content-attribute">RDFa</a> and Microdata syntax allow the use of a "content=" attribute for publishing simple machine-readable values
      alongside more human-friendly formatting.
</li>
<li>
      Use values from 0123456789 \(Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' \(U+0030\) to 'DIGIT NINE' \(U+0039\)\) rather than superficially similiar Unicode symbols.
